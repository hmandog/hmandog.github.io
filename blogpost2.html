    <h1>Exploring My Current Projects</h1>
    <p>Published on: March 3, 2025</p>

    <p>Hi, Hayden here again! In this post, I want to share some of the exciting projects I’m currently working on and exploring. These
       projects range from educational tools to toys and sustainable technology. Here’s a brief overview of the three main projects I'm diving into right now:</p>

    <h2>1. Educational Trainer Circuit Board</h2>
    <p>One of my current projects is designing an Educational Trainer Circuit Board. The idea behind this project is to create a hands-on tool
        for learning about circuits and electronics. It will feature various components that learners can interact with, allowing them to explore
        how different parts of a circuit work together. This project is a great way for both beginners and intermediate learners to get practical
        experience with circuit design and hands on learning.</p>

    <h2>2. Jakks Pacific "Power Trains"-Inspired Toy</h2>
    <p>Another project I’m excited about is creating a toy inspired by Jakks Pacific "Power Trains."
      I’m working on designing my own motorized toy train set, combining elements of creativity and engineering.
      This project is a lot of fun and allows me to incorporate my knowledge of electronics and mechanics to create
      a toy that is both entertaining and educational. I’m planning to 3D model parts to replicate the size and functionality
      of the classic Power Trains set.</p>

    <h2>3. Smart Recycling Bin</h2>
    <p>Lastly, I’m working on the Smart Recycling Bin. This project is focused on automating the sorting of recyclables using object recognition and AI.
       By using a USB camera and a Google Coral USB Accelerator (and maybe a barcode scanner), I plan to create a system that can identify and sort recyclables in real-time. This project
       has the potential to make recycling easier and more efficient, which is something I’m really passionate about. The Smart Recycling Bin will be equipped
       with a conveyor system and deflection arms to physically sort materials like paper, plastic, and metal.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>These projects are keeping me busy, and I’m excited to see where they go. Each one is unique, but they all share a common theme of combining technology with creativity and education.
      I’ll be sure to share updates as I make progress, and I’m looking forward to hearing any feedback or ideas you may have.</p>

    <p>Thanks for reading, and stay tuned for more updates!</p>
