                  Hi, I’m Hayden Hickerson, and welcome to my website! I’m a tech enthusiast and maker who loves working on electronics and robotics projects. I’m currently a student at Murray State University, working toward a Bachelor's in Applied Engineering with an emphasis on Controls and Automation, and I’m set to graduate in Spring 2026. This site is where I document my journey, share my projects, and hopefully inspire others who share my passion.
                  Growing up in Jackson, TN, I spent a lot of time helping my dad deliver pipe, fittings, and valves to industrial plants. While I once aspired to be an architect, being immersed in the manufacturing environment sparked my interest in engineering. This led me to pursue a career in engineering, where I’ve already gained valuable experience through multiple internships at Sonoco, a packaging company, in both Tennessee and Ohio. I also scored highly in a high school Microsoft Excel competition, which earned me a spot in the finals in Orlando, FL.
                  When I’m not working on low-voltage electronics, you can find me gaming, recycling scrap metal, listening to podcasts, or diving into languages and history. And of course, I always enjoy chatting with ChatGPT to explore new ideas.
                  I’m excited to continue my journey in engineering, and I invite you to check out my projects to see what I’ve been working on. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or just want to connect!
